# PythonforCybersecurityToolsInUse1-
This repository will provide 15 Python libraries used in Cybersecurity.
    Pandas, NumPy, NLTK
            Data Analysis, Visualization, natural language processing
            Malware Analysis, IDS, Threat Intelligence for detection of anomalies, Network Traffic Analysis, and more.
    Scikit-learn is a simple and efficient tools for training a big data set and analysis.
            Malware detection
            Network intrusion detection
            Network Traffic Analysis
    Nmap, Twisted, network security-related libraries, are widely used for scanniing and implementing transporter layer, application layer protocols.
    Scapy, used for packet processing decoding packets, forging packets, and analyzing the packet information on a network.
            to send, sniff, forge and decode network packets; scan traceroute, or attack networks.
            Packet Creation - enable the creation of custom packets.
            Scanning        - identify specific details about a network, like port scanning
            Sniffing        - intercepts and log the packets that flow across a particular network.
            ARP Cache Poisoning, record access points & MAC address.
            Man in the middle attack - allows viewing a victims activities.
            dislaying a raw outputs, allows creating networking tools without going into the details of building raw packets from scratch, whhich considerably diminishes the size of the code.
                    ARP cache poisoning
                    Traceroutes
                    Network discovery
                    Access Point Spoofing
    Beautiful Soup is used for scarping data from web pages in the form of HTML and XML.
    Cryptography Library    - implement cryptographic algorithms, specifically for the purpose of securing something, such as a file, communication, etc.
    YARA                    - malware identification and classification.
    Pymetasploit3           - Metasploit framework for discovering hidden vulnerabilities.
    Mechanize               - (which is similar to Beautiful Soup) data acquisition and for interacting with and getting data from the web pages; checking SQL injection and cross site scripting.
    XssPy                   - detecting Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in websites. 
                            - it doesn't scan just a single page, but multiple pages. This saves pen testers a lot of time since they only have to run the test once.    
    
    Pentesting:

    • Stage 1: Pre-Engagement - A cybersecurity team determines the objectives and logistics of the pen test.
	• Stage 2: Information Gathering - Pen testers rely on the Python libraries: NMAP, Twisted, Beautiful Soup, Scapy, Socket, Mechanize, and Devploit script. 
	• Stage 3: Threat Modeling - Pen testers rely on the Python libraries: Pytm Framework and Threat-modeling 0.0.1.
	• Stage 4: Vulnerability Scanning - Pen testers rely on the Python libraries: Vulners 1.5.13, Safety, and Scapy.
	• Stage 5: Exploitation - Pen testers rely on the Python libraries: Pymetaploit3  (to implement Metasploit framework), Scapy, Socket, and BYOB.
	• Stage 6: Post-Exploitation - Pen testers rely on the Python libraries: Pymetaploit3, BYOB, and RSPET.
	• Stage 7: Reporting - Pen testers rely on the Python libraries: Sys, Plotly, Pandas, and NLTK.
